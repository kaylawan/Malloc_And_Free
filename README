Memory Allocation and Management in C
_____________________________________

Objective:
•Implemented malloc and free functions from scratch, which are fundamental in memory allocation and management in C. To ensure the correctness of our implementation, we follow these steps:

The heap/heap.h header file defines four crucial variables:
•heap_size: This variable contains the total heap size in bytes, which is specified by the test.
•the_heap: This variable represents the memory allocated for the heap, as specified by the test.
•mCount: It keeps track of the number of times malloc is called, and you should define and update it in the heap.c file.
•fCount: Similarly, this variable tracks the number of times free is called, and you should define and update it in the heap.c file.

The implementation solely utilizes the memory allocated by the the_heap variable for managing the heap. We avoid using any additional memory sources.
